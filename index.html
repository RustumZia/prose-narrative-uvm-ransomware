          <span class="character-head">T</span><span id="main-body"></span>he IT department of the UVM Medical Center
          was aware of the series of cyberattacks going on against United States Health Centers. It was on their radar.
          But they were left helpless on October 28, 2020 when everyone across the medical center started having trouble
          accessing the computer systems. By then, thousands of computers and servers were already infected.

          The Medical Center
        </h3>
        <p class="parag" style="margin-top: 20px;">
          The UVM Medical Center claims to be a referral center for more than 1 million people in Vermont and northern
          New York. They store all clinical, anatomical, and administrative information in a database management system
          for the ability to retrieve that data at any time. They have established a network computing architecture
          which enables the flow of this information to and from customers, students and staff.

          A Haunting Fear
        </h3>

        <p class="parag">
          A New York Times article from late September of 2020 states that “it has been the fear haunting federal
          officials for a year now: in the days leading up to the election, or in its aftermath, ransomware groups will
          try to freeze voter registration data, election poll books or the computer systems of the secretaries of the
          state who certify election results.” CNN, in the same week of when the ransomware on the UVM Med Center hit,
          published an article on a recent ransomware attack on Hall County in Georgia. It affected critical systems and
          the voter signature database, as well as a voting precinct map hosted on the county's website, according to
          Katie Crumley, a Hall County spokesperson.

          October 28, 2020
        </h3>

        <p class="parag">
          With the incoming reports the IT department of UVM Medical Center suspected that their systems had been
          infected with malware. They took no chances; taking down internet access, employee email, and the electronic
          health record system. This may have saved the medical center from an irrecoverable predicament. A scan of all
          files was performed, and a single text file containing a brief worrying message was discovered. It included
          contact information for the attackers and demanded that they contact them if they wanted to restore their
          systems.
        </p>
        <div style="display: block; margin-bottom: 20px; width: max-content">
          <img

        </div>
        <p class="parag">
          But they never contacted the attackers as Gentile, Senior Vice President of Network Information Technology at
          the medical center explains to WCAX, “Because we already had backups, we were going to have to rebuild that
          anyways, just to ensure we got rid of the malware. So it wasn’t going to save us any time and, in fact, they
          encrypted some of the pieces you need to use with the key to de-encrypt, those were encrypted, so even if we
          had gotten the key, we couldn’t have used it.”
        </p>

        <p class="parag">
          In addition to their data being encrypted, malware was deposited across their devices, and if they wanted to
          ensure riddance of the malware everything would have to be wiped and rebuilt. And so even if they could
          decrypt their data it would leave malware, and they would still want to go through the process of a
          factory reset to get rid of it.
        </p>

        <h3 class="header-3">
          Not Alone
        </h3>

        <p class="parag">
          Not only were worries of ransomware undermining the U.S. election rising, but a series of these cyberattacks
          had recently been occurring on American Health Systems across the country. According to a survey done by UK
          based cybersecurity company Sophos, ⅓ of healthcare organizations were hit by ransomware in 2020, and 65% of
          those said the cybercriminals succeeded in encrypting their data.
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
          Ransomware is a kind of malware (malicious software) that can lock access to your computer files, systems, or
          networks. And often encrypts the data on your computer, external drives, and networked computers. According to
          the FBI, “You can unknowingly download ransomware onto a computer by opening an email attachment, clicking an
          ad, following a link, or even visiting a website that's embedded with malware.” Ransomware demands a ransom to
          unfreeze your computer or decrypt your files.
        </p>
        <h3 class="header-3">
          Rise of Malware
        </h3>
        <p class="parag">
          Cyberattacks, malware, and ransomware are on the rise. [...]
        </p>
        <h3 class="header-3">
          TrickBot and Botnets
        </h3>
        <p class="parag">
          The perpetrators of the ransomware attack on the UVM Medical Center were found to be a powerful,
          Russian-speaking cybercriminal group known to be behind a malware tool called TrickBot. TrickBot is a vast
          network of infected computers controlled by constantly changing internet servers to perform their own
          cyberattacks and expand the untraceable network. This is known as a botnet. According to Microsoft, “The
          botnet's operators have all the IT support of legitimate enterprises — continuity planning, backups, automated
          deployment, and a dedicated workforce — that allow them to quickly react to disruptive measures.” According to
          the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, “TrickBot now provides its operators a full suite
          of tools to conduct a myriad of illegal cyber activities. These activities include credential harvesting, mail
          exfiltration, cryptomining, point-of-sale data exfiltration, and the deployment of ransomware, such as Ryuk
          and Conti.”
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
          Last Fall, Microsoft and the U.S. Cyber Command took separate, significant action to take down TrickBot
          servers as it created a high risk of undermining the 2020 US Election.
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
          Microsoft analyzed infected computers and was able to determine exact IP addresses of servers that the
          infected computers were communicating with. Microsoft won court approval to disable these IP addresses by
          claiming TrickBot to be malicious use of Microsoft Windows software code.
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
          The U.S. Military Cyber Command was also taking action by hacking into TrickBot’s control centers.
        </p>
        <h3 class="header-3">
          
        </h3>
        <p class="parag">
          It was fortunate that the medical center had all essential data backed up before the ransomware as they would
          never get back anything that was encrypted. Only the attackers would have had the key to decrypt it, and
          breaking modern encryption is essentially impossible and will be for the foreseen amount of time. For example,
          a 256-bit encryption has 2<sup>256</sup> different possibilities, or about

        <h3 class="header-3">
          The Recovery
        </h3>
        <p class="parag">
          The day of the cyberattack Stephen Leffler, the president of the medical center, said to VTDigger, “We’re prepared if
          this lasts one more day or a week.” But what followed was a painstaking process of several weeks of cleaning
          and rebuilding 1,300 servers and 5,000 laptop and desktop computers. The Vermont National Guard was called in
          to aid in this. During this period the UVM Health Network stated that all media inquiries regarding the
          investigation should be directed to FBI Public Affairs Specialist Sarah Ruane.
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
          On November 16, almost 3 weeks after the incident, the medical center announced that they are continuing to
          make steady progress in recovering systems from the cyberattack. “The University of Vermont Medical Center,
          Central Vermont Medical Center, Porter Medical Center and Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital now all have
          ‘read-only’ access to Epic, our electronic health records management system.” But they said they have no
          timeframe and were unsure whether a full restoration of systems would be possible.
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
          Since the ransomware on the medical center hit there had been a significant spike in Covid-19 in Vermont and the country. 
          From October 28, the day
          of the cyberattack, to the day of this announcement, November 16, the 7-day daily average of new Coronavirus
          cases in Vermont quadrupled from 21 to 85 cases. And new cases across the US went from a 75k daily average to
          a 155k daily average.
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
          Eight days later, access to the Epic electronic medical record system was fully restored. And on November 27,
          two months following the ransomware attack, the medical center had restored the MyChart online patient portal
          which patients can log into via the website or MyChart mobile app. However, they also noted that “patients may
          see some temporary changes in the way they experience MyChart.”
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
          According to Leffler, 600 of their applications were impacted by the cyberattack and as of December 8 2020, 
          41 days after the cyberattack, over 70 applications were restored.
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
          Leffler says 6 weeks after the ransomware, "We really did not anticipate the scope or the impact the attack had
          on our system, and how far reaching it was. We had amazingly good strong plans for 3 days of downtime, 5 days of 
          downtime which is what we've experienced in the past. But 30 days of downtime across all systems was a true 
          challenge for our staff."
        </p>
        <p class="parag">
          Now, the Medical Center uses even more security precautions, improved security systems, and anti-virus software. 
          But is it ever enough? How excessive must these precautions eventually go? And how do we know what’s necessary?
